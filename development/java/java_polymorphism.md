> **POLYMORPHISM**
> A fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying data types or forms. There are two main types of polymorphism: compile-time (or static) polymorphism and runtime (or dynamic) polymorphism.
