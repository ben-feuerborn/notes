Two Types of Vulnerabilities
Design Flaw
Implementation Bug


> **THREATS**
> Exploit vulnerabilities in an application to perform attacks

# NETWORK THREATS
Software uses networks for communication, with other software or sub-modules. If the application is not designed and implemented properly, it can expose vulnerabilities to the attackers. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to perform different network threats.

## INFORMATION GATHERING
| **Feature** | **Passive** | **Active** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interaction** | No direct interaction | Direct interaction with target |
| **Detection Risk** | Low (stealthy) | High (easily detected) |
| **Legal Risk** | Low (uses public data) | High (may require permission) |
| **Information Accuracy** | Can be outdated | More accurate and real-time |
| **Impact on Target** | No impact | May cause service disruptions |

### Passive (Sniffing)
> **DEFINITION**
> Passive information gathering involves collecting data without directly interacting with the target system. The attacker or security analyst observes network traffic, publicly available data, and metadata without alerting the target.

Wireshark

### Active (Probing)
> **DEFINITION**
> Active information gathering involves direct interaction with the target system to collect detailed information. This often includes scanning, probing, and enumeration.

Port Scanning
SYN Scans
FIN Scans
