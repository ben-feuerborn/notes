> **PROTOCOL**
> A set of rules that define how information is sent, received, and interpreted

802 = LAN technologies
802.3 = Ethernet
|-- 802.3i = 10 Mbps
|-- 802.3u = 100 Mbps
|-- 802.3ab = 1 Gbps
|-- 802.3an = 10 Gbps (10GBASE-T)
802.11 = Wireless (WiFi)

10G = 10 Gigabits per second (speed)
BASE = Baseband (cables)
T = UTP (type of cable)

## Ethernet
Ethernet protocol describes physical links and how data is formatted

Media Access Control

UTP - Unshielded Twisted Pairs, twisted so that the magnetic fields generated by the flowing electric current don't interfere with signals. some pairs are for sending data (TX = transmission) while other are for receiving (RX = rexeiving). Modern UTP cables have 4 pairs of copper wires.

Straight Through - connects a host to a switch
Crossover - connects hosts to each other. Modern devices handle this automatically through MDI-X, which detects the cable type and adapts when needed.


## Fiber
Full Duplex - send and receive simultaneously
Half Duplex - takes turns sending and receiving

Single core - half duplex
Dual core - full duplex

Single Mode Fiber (SMF) -- laser light -- >2km -- more expensive
Multi Mode Fiber (MMF) -- LED light -- 500m -- cheaper

<!-- move and define -->
baseband is digital signals
broadband is analog signals

# Network Addressing
MAC Address
IP Address

Basics:
Hosts in a LAN have a MAC address and an IP address
A MAC address is used within a LAN segment
An IP address can be used within a LAN segment, and to pass traffic to a different LAN segment
